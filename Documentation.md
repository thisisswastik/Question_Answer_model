# Question_Answer_model
This project implements a Question Answering (QA) system using a Fine-Tuned Language Model (FLAN-T5-Large). The user inputs a paragraph, and the model generates answers to questions based on that paragraph.
We use the FLAN-T5-Large model, a fine-tuned version of Google's T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer).
Transformer-Based: The model follows the encoder-decoder architecture.
Fine-Tuned for Instruction Following: Unlike standard T5, FLAN-T5 is optimized for question-answering and task-specific prompts.
Sequence-to-Sequence Learning: It takes the question + context as input and generates an answer as output.
The following steps ensure that the input is properly formatted before passing it to the model:

ðŸ“Œ Text Cleaning & Formatting
Converts the question and passage into a structured input for FLAN-T5.
Strips unnecessary whitespaces.
ðŸ“Œ Tokenization
Uses Hugging Face's AutoTokenizer (google/flan-t5-large).
Converts text into input tokens for model processing.
ðŸ“Œ GPU Acceleration
Moves the model to cuda if a GPU is available, significantly improving speed.
 Implementation Details
ðŸ“Œ Streamlit UI Components
Text Area: Users enter a paragraph.
Text Input: Users type a question.
Model Execution: The system tokenizes the input, passes it to FLAN-T5, and decodes the output.
Display Section: Shows the generated answer in real time.
Evaluation Methodology
To evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy and response quality, we use manual validation and benchmark datasets.

ðŸ“Œ Evaluation Metrics
âœ… BLEU Score - Measures how well the generated answer matches the expected output.
âœ… ROUGE Score - Evaluates text similarity by comparing generated and reference answers.
âœ… Human Evaluation - Checks if the answers make sense and are factually correct.
ðŸ“Œ Sample Evaluation
Input Passage
"The Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889 and stands in Paris, France. It was originally criticized but later became a global icon."

Question
"When was the Eiffel Tower completed?"

Expected Output
"1889"

Generated Model Output
âœ… Correct Answer: "The Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889."
